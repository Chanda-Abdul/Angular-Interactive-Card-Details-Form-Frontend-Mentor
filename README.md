## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [X] Update the inputs on the form as the user fills in the fields and see the card details update in real-time
- [X] Validate the form fields when the form is submitted and receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - [X] Any input field is empty
  - [X] The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- [X] If there are no errors, display the completed state
- [X] Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
- [X] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [X] See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
