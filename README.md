## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [X] Update the inputs on the form as the user fills in the fields and see the card details update in real-time
- [X] Validate the form fields when the form is submitted and receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - [X] Any input field is empty
  - [X] The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- [X] If there are no errors, display the completed state
- [X] Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
- [X] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [X] See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
